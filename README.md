## Introduction:

By leveraging Fetch API, jQuery, CDNs, Moment.js, I was able to create a simple open weather app.

## Features:

- WHEN the user searches for a city, he/she is presented with current and future 5-day conditions for that city.
- The city is added to the search history and presented as buttons under the search bar.
- The weather card shows the city name, date and weather conditions.
- WHEN the user clicks on a city in the search history, the search result is again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Problems I've encountered:

- it's very hard to get the UV index out and present it with different colors. I was not able to do this.

## In conclusion:

The weather app is not easy to do, and it took me a lot of hours to do research and try out differnet codes. I'll keep trying to add features to this app.
